**Agenda:**

Go over papers from the mailing for the upcoming WG21 meeting in Prague

### p0843r3 static_vector

Aditya presents.
- Vector with fixed capacity, keeps growing up to a statically set maximum size.
- Works without dynamic memory, single contiguous storage
- Similar to std::array, but works with non-default-constructible objects
- Trying to put a 51st elemnt into a 50 element static_vector gives a bad_alloc
- Underlying value types may not throw; will trigger UB if they do.

Ryan: Would this be useful for us?
Aditya: Yes, because works with non-default-constructible objects and works without exceptions
Ryan: Implementation experience?
Aditya: Boost.
Andreas: Can't this be done with vector+allocator?
Aditya: Yes, but this has still value on its own because of usability.
Ruslan: This uses static internal memory. Does that kill move and swap between containers?
Aditya: Yes, it would fall back to a copy, the paper mentions that.
Ryan: An important question is do we want this? Would we use it, would we push for it?

### p1706r2 Programming LanguageVulnerabilities for Safety Critical C++
Ryan presents.
* WG23 has been meeting colocated with WG21 as part of SG12 meetings
* This paper explains the current state of MISRA and some of the issues they are discussing

Andreas: WG23 is a separate ISO standard describing language vulnerabilities for several programming languages, among them C++. It is not safety specific, but largely applies to safety. WG23 has had co-located meetings with WG21 for a while and because this was perceived as success, MISRA C++ decided to do the same, starting with Belfast.
???: When will MISRA next be released?
Andreas: There is no official announcement from MISRA for the date, but they are trying to wrap it up quickly.

### p1385r5 A proposal to add linear algebra support to the C++ standard library
Ryan presents.
* There's two proposals, one to standardize BLAS functionality, mostly HPC people as authors, as well as this proposals
* This is a spin-off from 2d graphics; defines linear algebra types and interfaces
* Currently in Library Incubator (LEWGI), targetting C++23
* Goal is to get performance comparable to Eigen
* Vector types offering customization points for various properties of types and operations
* Seems complicated to use, not sure if it's suitable for safety

No further discussion.

### p1935r2 A C++ Approach to Physical Units
Ryan presents.
* Currently discussed in Study Group 6 (Numerics) and Library Incubator (LEWGI)
* Directly applicable to us, because it prevents catastrophic unit conversion errors
* Paper contains a large survey of previous attempts at units libraries and their problems
* Paper makes heavy use of C++20 concepts. With terse syntax allows for quite readable code.

Andreas: This is very interesting, but still in an early stage.
Stephanie: There's still an open question about scope. The more flexible it needs to be, the longer it will take to complete

### Numerics
Ryan presents.
* p2004r1 complains about slow progress in SG6 and calls for 
* p1889r1 is an omnibus paper of all pending proposals currently stuck in SG6, handles overflow, rounding, conversion errors, ...
* Wide integer proposal to simulate integer types with sizes greater than 64 bits

Aditya: Wide int breaks assumptions about trivial numerical types.
Andreas: Is wide int even that interesting to safety?
Ryan: It might help avoid overflow, but of course proper overflow detection would be better.

### Open discussion
Aditya: Is the idea that we do these calls before each meeting and say which papers we are interested in?
Ryan: We are not officially part of WG21, so we have no power to make an official statement. But the individuals that go to the meeting can echo the interest voiced in the call.

Meeting adjourned.
