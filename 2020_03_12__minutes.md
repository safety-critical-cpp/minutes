### Speaker Presentation
Presentation of [P1935](https://wg21.link/p1935) A C++ Approach to Physical Units by Mateusz Pusz

- [A recent video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YW6yxkdhlU)
- [Current Implementation](https://github.com/mpusz/units)
- [Documentation](https://mpusz.github.io/units)

MP: Think this library is important for safety critical
MP: I have initial implementation in C++20 and web documentation
MP: My WG21 paper most discusses scope and basic decisions (not very much my library)
MP: I won't discuss Mars Rover incident, instead show you some code examples
MP: Why do we use type unsafe (ie. doubles everywhere)? 
MP: Not supported in std library -- helps adoption
MP: Lack of good alternatives (compilation errors, large or custom dependencies)
MP: Implementing this is actually hard
MP: Wide range of ratio magnitutes are supported
MP: <review of several existing units libraries>
MP: I have analyize and have experience with existing libraries and at lot categories of comparison
MP: Documentation is available on the website
MP: Library is available in godbolt
MP: We choose to use `q_km` for "quantity of km"
MP: We support SI and international customary units
MP: Quanitity cast and nice unit pretty printing with both std::ostream and std::format
MP: "downcasting facility" will use the most specific unit of representation when outputting or in debugger

### Questions
LB: What is the current state of your library?
MP: We still have some important design questions: ie. should we have user defined literals? "downcast" facility?
MP: Right now we are implementing in terms of SI (which have huge ratios), which with exponents might not fit in ratio
MP: Users can implement their own systems, but what is the right solution?
MP: We also have polls on github for important design questions
MP: We are still looking for initial users (since it's C++20 library)
MP: If you can create a Pull Request for examples from your domain
RM: My company is using nholthaus units
LB: My company used boost units, but it was too much of a pain
AP: Can it handle units "unknown" units (in terms of exponentiation)?
MP: Yes for example we can create velocity from multiplying meters by seconds
